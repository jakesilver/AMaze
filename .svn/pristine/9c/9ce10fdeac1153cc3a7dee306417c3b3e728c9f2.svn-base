 * Class stores a set of ranges, i.e., intervals.

 * 
 * Note: remove and intersect operate on a set of elements, however there is no method to add more than a single element to the set
 * as the set method removes all previous elements from the set. This only way to increase the cardinality is to split an existing interval
 * into two by way of the remove method.
 * 
 * This implies that ranges are disjoint and sorted in increasing order.
