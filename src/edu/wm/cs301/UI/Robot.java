/**
 * This interface specifies methods to operate a robot that resides in a maze on a particular location and with a particular direction.
 * An implementing class will configure the robot with sensors and a location within an existing maze.
 * It provides an operating platform for a robotdriver that experiences a maze (the real world) through the sensors and actors of this robot interface.
 * 
 * Note that a robot may be very limited in its mobility, e.g. only 90 degree left or right turns, which makes sense in the artificial terrain of a maze,
 * and its sensing capability, e.g. only a sensor on its front or left to detect remote obstacles. Left/right is a notion relative to the robot's direction 
 * or relative to the underlying maze. To avoid a confusion, the latter is considered a direction in an absolute sense and it may be better to describe it as 
 * north, south, east, west than up, down, right, left. 
 * 
 * A robot comes with a battery level that is depleted during operations such that a robot may actually stop if it runs out of energy.
 * This interface supports energy consideration. 
 * A robot may also stop when hitting an obstacle. 
 * 
 * WARNING: the use of CW_BOT/CW_TOP and (0,1) in Cells and Mazebuilder is inconsistent with the MapDrawer which has position (0,0) at the lower left and
 * a southbound direction on the map is (0,-1). Or in other words, the maze is drawn upside down by the MapDrawer. The rotation is calculated with 
 * polar coordinates (angle) towards a cartesian coordinate system where a southbound direction is (dx,dy)=(0,-1).
 * 
 * Implementing classes: movable robots with distance sensors of different kind. 
 * 
 * Collaborators: a maze class to be explored, a robotdriver class that operates robot
